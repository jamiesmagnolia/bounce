# Changelog

The dates are in dd-mm-yyyy.
Official changes documentation (excluding the existing git commits) started on 25 Oct 2024 because I was unfamiliar with versioning but decided that learning proper documentation might be useful.
So, documentation starts after deciding to refactor to pyglet and pymunk from just simply pygame.
This also means there will be no v0 in the changelog.

## v1.0.0 â€“ 25-10-2024
- Begin recreating base game using pyglet.
